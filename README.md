This repository contains the real life learning from the movie 'The Karate Kid'

The Karate Kid is a 1984 American martial arts drama film written by Robert Mark Kamen.
The Karate Kid follows Daniel LaRusso (Macchio), a teenager taught Gōjū-ryū karate by Mr. Miyagi (Morita) to help defend himself
and compete in a tournament against his bullies, one of which is the ex-boyfriend of his love interest Ali Mills (Shue).

17-year-old Daniel LaRusso moves with his mother Lucille to Reseda, Los Angeles, California from Newark, New Jersey at 
the start of the school year. Their apartment's handyman is an eccentric, but kindly and humble Okinawan immigrant named Mr. Miyagi.

Daniel befriends Ali Mills, an attractive high school cheerleader, which draws the attentions of her arrogant ex-boyfriend
Johnny Lawrence,a skilled practitioner and top student from the "Cobra Kai" dojo, where he studies an unethical and vicious 
form of karate. Johnny and his Cobra Kai gang continually torment Daniel, savagely beating him up on Halloween until Mr. Miyagi
intervenes and single-handedly defeats them with ease. Amazed, Daniel asks Mr. Miyagi to teach him karate. Miyagi refuses, but 
agrees to bring Daniel to the Cobra Kai dojo to resolve the conflict. They meet with the sensei, John Kreese, an ex-Special 
Forces Vietnam veteran who callously dismisses the peace offering. Miyagi then proposes that Daniel enter the All-Valley Karate 
Championships, where he can compete with Johnny and the other Cobra Kai students on equal terms, and requests that the bullying
cease while Daniel trains. Kreese agrees to the terms, but warns that if Daniel does not show up for the tournament, 
the harassment will continue on both Daniel and Miyagi.

Daniel's training starts with menial chores that he believes only makes him Miyagi's slave. When he becomes frustrated, Miyagi 
demonstrates that these actions have helped him to learn defensive blocks through muscle memory. Their bond develops and Miyagi 
opens up to Daniel about his life that includes the dual loss of his wife and son in childbirth at the Manzanar internment camp 
while he was serving with the 442nd Infantry Regiment during World War II in Europe, where he received the Medal of Honor. 
Through Mr. Miyagi's teaching, Daniel learns not only karate but also important life lessons such as the importance of personal
balance, reflected in the principle that martial arts training is as much about training the spirit as the body. Daniel applies 
the life lessons that Miyagi has taught him to strengthen his relationship with Ali. On Daniel's birthday, Miyagi presents him 
the uniform he will wear at the tournament and his own car as his birthday gifts.

At the tournament, Daniel surprises everyone by reaching the semi-finals. Johnny advances to the finals, scoring three unanswered 
points against Darryl Vidal. Kreese instructs his second best student Bobby Brown, one of his more compassionate students and the
least vicious of Daniel's tormentors, to disable Daniel with an illegal attack to the knee. Bobby reluctantly does so, severely 
injuring Daniel and getting disqualified in the process. Daniel is taken to the locker room, with the physician determining that
he can't continue, but Daniel believes that if he does not continue, his tormentors will have gotten the best of him. He convinces
Miyagi to use a pain suppression technique to allow him to continue. As Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default, Daniel
returns to fight. The match is a seesaw battle, as neither is able to break through the other's defense.

The match is halted when Daniel uses a scissor leg technique to trip Johnny, delivering a blow to the back of the head and giving
Johnny a nose bleed. Kreese directs Johnny to sweep Daniel's injured leg, an unethical move. Johnny looks horrified at the order, 
but reluctantly agrees. As the match resumes, Johnny seizes Daniel's leg and delivers a vicious blow, doing further damage. 
Daniel, standing with difficulty, assumes the "Crane" stance, a technique he observed Mr. Miyagi performing on a beach. Johnny 
lunges toward Daniel, who jumps and delivers a front kick to Johnny's face, winning the tournament. Johnny, having gained newfound
respect for his nemesis, presents the trophy to Daniel himself, as Daniel is carried off by an enthusiastic crowd.
